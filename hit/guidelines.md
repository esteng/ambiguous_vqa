# Annotation guidelines

You will be presented with a series of images, questions about those images, and candidate answers. 
The answers were obtained from real people, who sometimes disagree on the answer to an image-question pair. The goal of this 
HIT is to annotate reasons why people disagree on an example. 

Please read all the instructions before beginning. There will be two tasks for each image-question-answer example presented. 

The first task is to determine whether the candidate answers fall into multiple distinct groups. 

For example, for the following example, there are XX distinct groups: 

On the other hand, this example does not have distinct groups, even though the responses are slightly different. 

If there are distinct groups, the second task is the categorize the examples by why you think there are different groups. 
Possible reasons are: 
1. Subjective questions
    - example: 
2. Questions about mental states
    - 
3. Question about inferring motion from an image
    - 
4. Question about predicting the future 
    - 
5. Differences in specificity 
    - QUDS examle 
6. Other: Please specify
